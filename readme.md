Disimpy is a digital circuit simulator in Python.

For now, it is just a dump for my ideas.

Todo & wish list:
- library != BOM
- how does the user make a new building block?
- tests
- delay per output + longest
- don't care in truth table
- multiplexers etc.
- derive from nand
- how should a user make a library
- library == circuit??
- library names??
- feedback
- statistics ordering: gates, specific gates, input, output
- truth table columns
